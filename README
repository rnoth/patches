some patches for things. mostly suckless

	nograb.diff:
	 - use XSelctInput(3) instead of XGrabKeyboard(3)

	scroll.diff
	 - scroll long text within dmenu
	 - means you can type long text in a dmenu without (much) pain
	 - particularly useful for ../iiscripts/iimenu.sh

	lazyfocus:
	 - open new windows without focusing them immediately
