some patches for things. mostly suckless

dmenu:
	nograb.diff:
	 - use XSelectInput(3) instead of XGrabKeyboard(3)
	 - allows you to use wm keybinds with a dmenu open
	scroll.diff
	 - scroll long text within dmenu
	 - means you can type long text in a dmenu without (much) pain
	 - particularly useful for ../iiscripts/iimenu.sh
	config.h
	 - boring configuration details
tabbed:
	lazyfocus:
	 - open new windows without focusing them immediately
	 - breaks Ctrl+Shift+Enter somewhat
